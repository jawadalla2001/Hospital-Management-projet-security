# Security Audit and Improvements

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the Hospital Management System and the improvements implemented to address them.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

The security audit revealed the following critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords were stored in plain text, making them easily accessible if the database was compromised.
2. **SQL Injection**: Direct string concatenation in SQL queries throughout the application made it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: No CSRF protection was implemented for form submissions.
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: No consistent content security policy or XSS protection mechanisms.
5. **Insecure Session Management**: Session configuration lacked security options such as httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags.
6. **Username Enumeration**: Different error messages for invalid usernames vs. passwords revealed which usernames exist in the system.
7. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Email credentials were hardcoded in the application code.
8. **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against brute force login attempts.
9. **Weak Authentication**: Basic authentication without modern security features.
10. **Insecure Direct Object References**: Many routes used direct object references without proper authorization checks.

## Security Improvements Implemented

The following security improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Secure Password Management
- Implemented bcrypt for password hashing
- Created automatic password upgrade from plain text to secure hash
- Strengthened password requirements

### 2. Protection Against SQL Injection
- Replaced direct string concatenation with parameterized queries
- Implemented prepared statements for database interactions

### 3. CSRF Protection
- Implemented CSRF protection using the csurf package
- Added CSRF tokens to all forms
- Added middleware to validate CSRF tokens

### 4. Enhanced XSS Protection
- Implemented Content Security Policy with helmet
- Added X-XSS-Protection headers
- Secured cookie handling

### 5. Improved Session Security
- Enhanced session configuration with secure, httpOnly, and sameSite flags
- Implemented session expiration
- Generated secure session secrets

### 6. Environment Variable Management
- Implemented dotenv for secure environment configuration
- Moved sensitive information to environment variables
- Created .env.example template for setup guidance

### 7. Authentication Security
- Improved login process with bcrypt password verification
- Added generic error messages to prevent username enumeration
- Implemented secure email verification process
- Added rate limiting for login attempts

### 8. Error Handling
- Added proper error handling middleware
- Created user-friendly error pages (404, 500)
- Implemented logging for security events

### 9. Security Headers
- Added security headers with helmet
- Implemented HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Added X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options headers

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

The following additional security measures are recommended:

1. **Database Security**:
   - Implement connection pooling for better reliability
   - Add database encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement least privilege principles for database access

2. **Authentication Enhancements**:
   - Implement two-factor authentication
   - Add account lockout policy after failed attempts
   - Implement password reset with secure tokens

3. **Transport Layer Security**:
   - Enforce HTTPS throughout the application
   - Configure secure TLS settings
   - Implement certificate pinning

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement comprehensive security logging
   - Add intrusion detection mechanisms
   - Create security event alerts

5. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add proper authorization checks for all routes
   - Implement API rate limiting

6. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies for security patches
   - Implement automated dependency scanning
   - Remove unused dependencies

7. **Secure Code Practices**:
   - Conduct regular code reviews
   - Implement automated security testing
   - Follow secure coding standards

## Security Configuration

Security-related configuration is now managed through environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the following settings:

```
# Security
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret
BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-secure-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=Your App Name <your-secure-email@example.com>
```

## Running in Production Mode

To run the application in production mode with all security features enabled:

```bash
npm run prod
```

## Security Testing

Before deploying to production, run a security check on dependencies:

```bash
npm run security-check
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact the development team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by the team.
